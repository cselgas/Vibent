## Imports
Since the data-cube is a Numpy nested dictionary, we need to import Numpy to work with the values. Matplotlib is also imported for visualizations:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

## Using the Data
```python
# Reading the data cube (Replace 'x' with latest version)
data = np.load('data_cube_vx.npy',allow_pickle='TRUE').item()

# Returns the entire cube
print(data)

# Working with Values
# The example below would give you the centroid value for the 3rd Line in Order 50 for Feb 8, 2021 @ 19:10:24
centroid = data['Time 20210208T191024')]['Order 50']['Line 3']['centroid']
```
